## PROJECTS I'M MOST PROUD OF

- [**Socio Africa**](https://www.socio.africa):
Co-engineered an African-led social media platform, Socio Africa, at Socio Technologies. As the lead backend engineer, I built and scaled the server-side infrastructure using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. The platform is divided into microservices, including authentication and a newsfeed service. My key contributions include:

  - 🛠️ Developed API endpoints and integrated MongoDB for seamless data storage.
   
  - 🖼️ Utilized Cloudinary for storing and managing images from user profiles, communities, and posts.
   
  - 🔒 Implemented secure user authentication with access and refresh tokens.

  - ✍️ Created algorithms for users to create, edit, comment, and react to posts.
   
  - 🚀 Optimized performance with a pagination algorithm for loading posts and communities efficiently.
   
  - 🌐 Enabled users to create and engage in topic-based communities, sharing posts within groups.
   
  - ⚡ Improved database operations with indexing, reducing query times and latency.

- [**GO.Charity**](https://github.com/gocharity):
One of my notable projects is the GO.Charity platform, where I architected a microservices-based system deployed on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster. This involved deploying each microservice on Pods within the Cluster, implementing monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform.

- [**Online Auction**](https://github.com/onukwilip/onlineAuction):
Furthermore, I developed an online auction platform that leverages the power of serverless computing on GCP. The application was built as a progressive web app (PWA), featuring offline support, client-side caching, and web notifications. I implemented a CI/CD pipeline that deploys
the Dockerized app to Google Cloud Run.

- [**GOPack**](https://github.com/onukwilip/gopack): 
GOPack is an open-source JavaScript library built using Node Js, webpack, and babel. It was developed to help javascript developers unfamiliar with webpack bundle their projects into static files using pre-written webpack configuration and pre-installed loaders.
GOPack currently supports a few JavaScript libraries like React Js, Typescript,
Vue Js, Ejs, Pug, Handlebars, SASS, etc, and is currently expanding its codebase and supporting more libraries.
GOPack is currently open source, so interested developers can fork the GitHub repo, make/commit changes and create pull requests.
Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my projects and contributions. If you're interested in collaborating or have any exciting projects in mind, let's connect and bring your ideas to life! 🚀

- [**NigTrak**](https://github.com/onukwilip/NigTrak):
This is a real-time tracking web application i alongside fellow team members developed for the organization i currently work for. It is an MVP application which tracks registered personnel wherever they are in the world via the mobile application installed on their devices. Technologies involved are React Js, MQTT, Google maps API, Node Js, MSSQL, etc

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS!
- Had the opportunity to contribute to the Freecodecamp project, thereby leveling up in the Hacktoberfest program. I collaborated with others on the platform in the creation of E2E tests using Microsoft Playwright. Fixed merge conflicts by rebasing the feature branch to the main branch.
- Co-engineered Socio Africa, an African-led social media startup, as one of its founding software engineers. Developed the server-side application using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB for robust API endpoints and databases. Contributed to boosting customer turnout on the platform, achieving over 500+ customers within the first-month post-launch.
- Won the award of the most-innovative staff during my previous role as a software developer.
