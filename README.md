# DevOps and Cloud Architect 😃

I’m a **DevOps and Cloud Engineer** experienced in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Azure Cloud, Azure DevOps** ☁️💻. 

I **automate the provisioning of resources on the Cloud** using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with **Terraform** 🤖. I **speed up the deployment of applications using CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps ⚙️.

I **inform teams concerning potential issues in applications before they reach the customers** via monitoring and alerting strategies using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki 📊. 

I follow security practices in the deployment of applications by adhering to OWASP Top 10, and **securing application credentials** using tools like Infisical, **Azure Key Vaults**, etc 🔐

I also **ensure applications can handle high traffic and thousands of users with no problems** by deploying into Docker containers and **managing them on Kubernetes** 🐋🕸️

I also scale applications/infrastructure across multiple regions/availability zones during traffic surges and creating load balancers to evenly distribute traffic across each service.

# My Achievements

✅I eliminated the manual creation of resources on Azure Cloud for a Fintech platform by automating resource creation with Terraform.

I automated and sped up the deployment of each microservice application on Azure Function Apps, seeding and migration of the SQL databases using Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines

**Here's a case study explaining what I did in detail and it's result -** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TD-ZP3M9aRIKnO-x2f_tG77EVW6US3FH/view?usp=sharing

✅I deployed a startup that scaled to over 23,000+ active users within months. 

I reduced Cloud costs from $900/month to $50/month by migrating the platform to DigitalOcean VM instance, deploying their applications on the VM using Coolify web server, configuring the DNS, reverse proxy and networking. 

I set up custom Grafana dashboards to monitor app performance. Metrics were retrieved from Prometheus, and I created alert rules and notification channels to notify the team when potential issues were discovered.

✅I managed a complex microservice platform by deploying into Docker containers on Google Kubernetes Engine. 

I reduced the need to manually redeploy updates on the cluster by creating CI/CD pipelines to auto-redeploy application updates by publishing the apps into Docker containers re-deploying them on the Kubernetes Cluster using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

✅I ensured a crowd-funding platform could handle traffic surges easily by implementing auto-scaling and load balancing using Google Cloud Managed Instance Groups

I reduced the need to manually create the resources on the Cloud and redeploy the applications by using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines and Terraform to automate the creation of the resources.
