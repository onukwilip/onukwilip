## PROJECTS I'M MOST PROUD OF
- [**OnlineAuction**](https://github.com/onukwilip/onlineAuction):
Crafted an online auction platform using Next Js enabling users to list, bid, and receive email notifications for expiring products and highest bids. Implemented a CI/CD workflow which deploys the app container to Google Cloud Run serverless platform. Made the web app a progressive web app which can not only be installed on a user's device, but also supports caching of client-side resources e.g. pages, images, etc, Web notifications (when a user gets out-bid) using service workers and indexedDb and offline support.

- [**GOPack**](https://github.com/onukwilip/gopack): 
GOPack is an open-source JavaScript library built using Node Js, webpack, and babel. It was developed to help javascript developers unfamiliar with webpack bundle their projects into static files using pre-written webpack configuration and pre-installed loaders.
GOPack currently supports a few JavaScript libraries like React Js, Typescript,
Vue Js, Ejs, Pug, Handlebars, SASS, etc, and is currently expanding its codebase and supporting more libraries.
GOPack is currently open source, so interested developers can fork the GitHub repo, make/commit changes and create pull requests.
Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my projects and contributions. If you're interested in collaborating or have any exciting projects in mind, let's connect and bring your ideas to life! 🚀

- [**NigTrak**](https://github.com/onukwilip/NigTrak):
This is a real-time tracking web application i alongside fellow team members developed for the organization i currently work for. It is an MVP application which tracks registered personnel wherever they are in the world via the mobile application installed on their devices. Technologies involved are React Js, MQTT, Google maps API, Node Js, MSSQL, etc

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS!
- Had the opportunity to contribute to the Freecodecamp project, thereby leveling up in the Hacktoberfest program. I collaborated with others on the platform in the creation of E2E tests using Microsoft Playwright. Fixed merge conflicts by rebasing the feature branch to the main branch.
- Developed a 3D web editor leveraging tools like Three Js, React three fiber and drei. The website mimmiks an ecommerce shop by giving the users ability to edit a product to their taste on an online editor, giving them a 3 dimensional preview of how the product would look like when ordered.
- Won the award of the most-innovative staff during my previous role as a software developer.
